# Actionable Influence

### Choose the problem:
Given a place (restaurant, park, museum, etc.) find the influencer that created the most actionable post/review. For example, after leaving a positive review does this person's friends later go to that place? Does that friend's friend go?

This will be done using Yelp's dataset. In theory it should be easy as Yelp has an easy influencer distinguisher - the Yelp Elite. From here I can see if that influencer's friends went to the restaurant with Yelp's check in function or if they left a review.
